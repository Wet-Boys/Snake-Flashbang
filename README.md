# IMPORTANT

- You need to assign emotes in game, the default keybind is C, then look in the top right corner to customize your emote wheel.

## Current Emotes

- Pain

- xQc Clap

## What even is this?

- Where other mods we have like BadAssCompany or TF2Emotes are (mostly) emotes that people have requested over the last few years and/or just ripped from games. This pack is specifically emotes that we have a strong drive to make. As a result the quality will remain high, but please understand if it means there will not be a ton of emotes in this pack. We do have plans for more emotes in the future, we are just kinda busy with so many games coming out right now.
